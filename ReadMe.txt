Student Restaurants

Based on Aalto University Ohjelmointistudio assignment.
Idea was to do Application which read two different student restaurants menus and show them in GUI.
Project is not ready yet and it's modified 2020 and there is changes in json files and sites.
For that reason it can't for example read menus from Fazer restaurants.
